# NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
This is one of the projects from datacamp.
Objectives:
1. Create a pandas DataFrame for all schools where the results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score.
2. Identify the top 10 performing schools based on scores across the three SAT sections, storing as a pandas DataFrame, with results sorted by total_SAT in descending order.
3. Locate the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation for "total_SAT", storing as a DataFrame.
